# attendance-web

A website that will store the attendance information of my day to day college, and will display the percentage.

## Plan

1. Take the week timetable.
2. Take list of all the subjects.
3. Options to select the attendance information every day.
4. Show the percentage of individual subjects.
5. Add classes outside the day's schedule.
6. Make it work for multiple users _(single user for easy development)_
7. Use some SQL database _(because it looks like this is a lot of data to be stored for months)_.
8. Might use AWS // VPS for database and hosting.
9. The user management part is taking forever and I have to have a working solution by 20 November 2023. So I will leave it here for future-me to figure out.

## How to run it locally

1. Install node dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. a. Use nodemon to run the server

   ```bash
   nodemon
   ```

   b. Run the server manually

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Site is live at `localhost:3000`. Open it in your preferred browser.

Due to the very limited time and too high requirement, it is highly suggested to help me fulfill this challenge/dream task.
